Certainly! Hereâ€™s a rule for the game you described:

---

**Dice Roll Game Rules:**

1. **Objective**: Players aim to earn the highest score by rolling a die and accumulating points.

2. **Players**: The game is played by two players.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.
   - If a player rolls a **1**, their turn ends immediately, and the turn passes to the other player.
   - If a player rolls a **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, or **6**, they earn points equal to the number rolled and continue their turn.

4. **Scoring**:
   - The points rolled (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) are added to the player's score.
   - If a player rolls a 1, no points are added for that roll, and the turn ends.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game continues until a predetermined winning score is reached (e.g., 100 points), or for a set number of rounds.
   - The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
